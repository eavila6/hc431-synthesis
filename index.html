                        The path the WGA travels on is long and winding, but not lonely.
                        As of this writing, the WGA intends to remain on strike for at least eight more months.
                        One of the keys to achieving this is by fostering resilience, which can only be attained by engaging in violence as exemplified by the Wobblies and as outlined by Fanon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This type of engagement (a violent engagement) is critical as it challenges the status quo and spurns the authority of those in power.
                        This is of particular concern with today’s WGA strike since screenwriters across America have been underpaid for years which has just now been responded with demands for reform backed by picket lines, walkouts, malicious compliance, and quiet quitting—
                        this is common, tacit violence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, the punchiness, boldness, and the fact the WGA delved headlong into this situation should be reassuring to you:
                        they’re fighting against new technologies that threaten to annihilate the existence of their jobs.
                        Proverbial metallic wolves in sheep’s clothing are now a very real threat as artificial intelligence research progresses, which will indubitably pose a threat to all of our jobs at some time in the future.
                        The WGA’s active approach shows all of us that we always have a fighting chance against oppression and that we can resist the currents of exploitation that threaten to drag us under.
